# us_election_2020
A toy model for predicting the 2020 US presidential election outcome

Ideas:

* Can we train a model on the 2016 election results using only demographic data and the previous election results?

* Can we update that model somehow using polling data such that we can create new estimates for other (un-polled states)?

* Can we use these synthetic polls to estimate the results of the 2020 election based on some recent polls?

The answers are probably: 'yes', 'probably not' and 'probably not'.

That said, a first attempt is contained in the notebooks folder.

Most recent prediction (26th October 2020): Trump 203 : Biden 335 (electoral college votes)
